# Student-Life-Management-App
Student Life Management App is an android application which will allow students to manage their day-to-day class activities.

This project was designed with a focus on ease of use for second-year computer science students at my university. Here, admin can update teacher's information and class schedules according to semester, while users can create tasks and calculate GPA according to their needs. Users can also interact with teacher's information and class schedules.

The project is developed in Java using Android Studio, with Firebase serving as the database.
